Inspiration

                                â€¢It was quite challenging setting up an environment on Visual Studio Code where we can actually start the entire project. Series of research were done on google without significant solutions. To widen up our scope of knowledge, we watched several video clips on youtube. Following all the steps and processes highlighted on google and youtube, we end up achieving little success. We finally got a breakthrough with the step-by-step guidelines shown on ChatGPT.
