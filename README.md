# Smart School Management System (SSMS)
# INTRODUCTION
Smart school management system (SSMS) is a proposed solution to integrate the
traditional basic and college education into the modern system of education with the touch of software. The primary goal of this project is to create a platform that enables the formal interaction of students, parents, teachers and other stakeholders. It also focuses on development of reliable and responsive cloud based applications to improve timeliness and easy accessibility of information.

Inspiration
We were inspired to embark on this Smart School Management System (SSMS) due to numbers of reasons ranges from parent's inconveniences, loss of students' information, disintegrating key stakeholders from the system of education and essentially, over dependency on traditional hardcopy result collection in the midst of 21st century.

                                For instance, I was asked to represent my Uncle, whose child attends one of the best city college in Lagos Island, Lagos State, Nigeria. The purpose of the representation was to obtain his child's college report sheet. With the poor road network and heavy traffic in Lagos Island for about four (4) hours, I got to the School late and missed the Desk Officer in charge of result collection. She had closed for the day due to my ten (10) minutes lateness behind the official closing time. The best option given by one of the school Administrators was to come back the following day. I began to ask myself, I would be coming back to face the same traffic I had no control over and also facing the same traditional system of result collection.

                                After sitting beside numbers of parents and guidance for few minutes at the school reception to regain my loss strength and energy. I had a thought of bringing an end to parents' unnecessary stress and proffer a lasting solution to students result collection at the comfort of parents' home with the aid of application's development. While still on the transit to return home, empty handed, I began to think beyond result collection and considered development of a complete School Management solution needed in the 21st century that brings all the stakeholders (parents, students, school administrators, teachers and government) together for effective service delivery. This boosted my morale and aided the flow of blood in my veins to see the end of an application that is capable of solving multiple college problems.
The following challenges came up when we started:

                                â€¢It was quite challenging setting up an environment on Visual Studio Code where we can actually start the entire project. Series of research were done on google without significant solutions. To widen up our scope of knowledge, we watched several video clips on youtube. Following all the steps and processes highlighted on google and youtube, we end up achieving little success. We finally got a breakthrough with the step-by-step guidelines shown on ChatGPT.
